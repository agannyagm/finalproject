        <label>Ingredients</label>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups dry milk powder</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed cardamom</li>
            <li>Few strands of saffron</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk to soak the saffron</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sliced pistachios for garnishing</li> 
        </ul>
        <br />
        <label>Method</label>
        <ul>
            <li>Soak the saffron strand in warm milk. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the frying pan on low heat, I like to use heavy bottom nonstick pan. Add cream and milk powder. Mix it well. Mix will start getting soft consistency of thick batter as it gets warm.</li>
            <li>Cook mixture on low medium heat stirring continuously until mixture becomes lumpy like soft dough. This should take about 12-15 minutes. Add saffron and cardamom mix it well and cook for 2-3 more minutes until it is consistency of soft dough. Turn off the heat. Now this is known as khoya.</li>
            <li>Transfer the khoya into a bowl and let it cool off until khoya becomes lukewarm.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar into the khoya and knead it for about a minute until everything blends together and become soft dough. Note: if you mix the sugar while khoya is hot that will make khoya soft and will not able to make peda.</li>
            <li>Divide the mix into 20 equal parts or more, less depends the size you prefer. Make them into ball rolling between your palms. Make a dent into the peda.
            Garnish them with pistachios.</li>
            <li>Finish peda consistency should be little grainy. </li>            
        </ul>
